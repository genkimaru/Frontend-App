## JS language evaluation

### dynamic language, for example javascript
- no stick type system
- no compile check
- no machine code or middle code , no link stage.
- hard to to build large-scale project



### static language - for example Java
- stick type system
- compile check
- bytecode generation
- capable of building large-scale  project.

### the advantage of JS
- strong binding with browser environment
- function is the first citizen of JS.
- heritage based on prototype chain 
- typescript bring type system into the ecosystem of JS.

### the disadvantage of JavaScript
- browser API for JS is too thin , but changes has happened
- no unique way to do things because of its flexibility.
